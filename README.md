# CompGeoLab Paper Template

## What is this?

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for
generating new paper repository
It will automatically populate a paper repository containing the manuscript, code and
notebooks for reproducing the results, needed data, results, etc.

## What do you need to use this?

1. Install ``cookiecutter`` through conda or pip.
2. Create a repository (probably in the CompGeoLab GitHub organization).

## Creating the repository

Step by step instructions:

- Create a repository at CompGeoLab. Ask [Leonardo Uieda](https://www.leouieda.com) to
  do it for you if you don't have permissions to do so.

- The `project_slug` must not contain spaces or dashes. Replace them with underscores
  (this will be the name of the Python package).

- Reserve a DOI at Zenodo or figshare for the repository (supplement).

- Explain the different DOIs that will be associated with the same publication: DOI for
  the supplement, DOI for the preprint and DOI for the version of record (released by
  the Journal).
