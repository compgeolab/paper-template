# Source code

This folder contains all source code used to generate the results in the paper.

## Best practices

Here are a few recommendations for how to manage code in this folder:

1. Place reusable code (functions/classes) in separate `.py` files that can be imported.
1. Number Jupyter notebooks with 2 digits (`01-`, `03-`, etc) in the recommended order of execution.
1. Generate figures for the paper in separate notebooks/scripts, not the one where computations happen.
1. Ideally, have 1 notebook/script per figure (or group of similar figures).
