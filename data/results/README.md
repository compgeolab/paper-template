# Results of computations

These are the files containing the final results from the analysis (e.g., model
outputs, predictions, etc.). Store them here under version control only if the
files are not large (< 50 Mb). Otherwise, publish them separately to an
appropriate repository (e.g. on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or
[figshare](https://figshare.com/)).
