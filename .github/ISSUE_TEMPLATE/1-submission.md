## Checklist

- [ ] Reserve a DOI on [figshare](https://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for the supplementary material (a zip archive of this repository). Paste the DOI at the top of this issue.
- [ ] Add the reserved DOI to `paper/information.tex` and the main `README.md`.
- [ ] Do one final proof-read of the whole paper, double-checking format, figures, and equations.
- [ ] Submit the preprint to [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/) (make sure
  all authors have accounts that include their ORCIDs otherwise they won't be
  linked automatically).
- [ ] Add the preprint DOI to `paper/information.tex` and the main `README.md`.
- [ ] Make the GitHub repository public (if it isn't already).
- [ ] Make a release on GitHub with the `submitted` tag. You could also append
  the journal initials to the tag, like `submitted-gji`.
- [ ] Upload the `.zip` archive of the repository from the GitHub release to figshare/Zenodo and publish it.
- [ ] Update the EarthArXiv version so it includes the EarthArXiv DOI.
- [ ] Make a cover letter for the journal using `paper/cover-letter.tex`. Include a short summary of the paper, a statement about it being posted as a preprint under CC-BY, suggested reviewers, and contributions by student authors.
- [ ] Submit the paper to the journal.
- [ ] Make a nice summary figure or graphical abstract for social media and the website. This should be in 2:1 aspect ratio and easily readable on mobile devices (so large fonts).
- [ ] Create a news item on the CompGeoLab website.
- [ ] Share the preprint DOI link on social media, including a link to our website.
