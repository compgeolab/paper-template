\section{Methodology}


\noindent
The estimated dipole moment vector $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ can be converted into
declination $D$, inclination $I$, and magnitude $m$, which are more intuitive
quantities for interpreting paleomagnetic results, like so

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_vector_to_incdec}
\begin{aligned}
I &= \tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{m_z}{\sqrt{m_x^2 + m_y^2}}\right) \ , \\
D &= \tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{m_x}{m_y}\right) \ , \\
m &= \sqrt{m_x^2 + m_y^2 + m_z^2} \ .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
