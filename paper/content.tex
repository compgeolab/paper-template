\section{Methodology}

This is Euler's homogeneity equation

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_euler_homogeneity}
  (x - x_c)\partial_x f + (y - y_c)\partial_y f + (z - z_c)\partial_z f
  = (b - f)\eta
  \ ,
\end{equation}

\noindent
in which $(x_c, y_c, z_c)$ are the coordinates of the magnetic field source,
$b$ is the base level representing a constant shift in the signal, and $\eta$
is the structural index corresponding to the nature of the source. You can
reference the equation in the text like this:
Equation~\ref{eq_euler_homogeneity}.
