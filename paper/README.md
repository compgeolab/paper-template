# LaTeX source code for the preprint and journal manuscript

This folder contains the LaTeX source code and figures used to generate the
preprint and manuscript for journal submission.

## Files and folders

* `content.tex`: Contains the actual text for the paper, except for the
  abstract and information like title and authors.
* `abstract.tex`: The abstract.
* `abstract-plain.tex`: A plain language version of the abstract.
* `preprint.tex`: The main preprint template for EarthArXiv. Includes the
  information in the other files.
* `figures`: Contains all figures. Results figures are generated by the code in
  the `code` folder.
* `Makefile`: GNU Make rules for building the PDF documents.

You mainly will be editing `content.tex`, `preprint.tex`, `abstract-plain.tex`,
and `abstract.tex`.

## Creating the PDFs

To create the PDFs from the LaTeX sources, run `make` in this folder from a
terminal. You will need to have the virtual environment activated to guarantee
that you have GNU Make and Tectonic installed.
